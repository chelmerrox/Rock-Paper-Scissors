# Rock Paper Scissors game

## Description

This is my attempt at using my current knowledge in JavaScript to build the 'Rock Paper Scissors' game as instructed. At this point, no HTML or CSS is added yet, hence the web page being empty. The game will be played on the console (console tab of the web browser's - preferably Google Chrome - developer tools).
